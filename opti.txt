# Cost Optimization Strategies for Jira and PostgreSQL Upgrade

## Cost Optimization Analysis
- **Infrastructure Review**: Assess the current infrastructure's cost efficiency. Consider the use of cloud-based services such as AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, which offers automated backups, scaling, and patching, potentially reducing the need for manual maintenance.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Consider alternative hosting options, such as migrating to Atlassian Cloud or consolidating Jira instances. Evaluate the costs and benefits of each option, including potential savings on hardware, licensing, and administrative overhead.
- **Resource Optimization**: Review the system requirements for Jira 9.x to determine if hardware or virtual machine upgrades are necessary. Plan for potential increases in resource consumption due to new features and enhancements.

### Cost-Related Questions to Ask the Jira Infrastructure Team
- How can we optimize the current infrastructure to reduce costs, such as by adjusting instance sizes or using reserved instances?
- Are there any cost benefits to migrating Jira to the cloud, and what are the potential trade-offs? How do we handle data residency and compliance requirements in a cloud environment?
- What are the potential savings from optimizing database performance? For example, could better indexing or query optimization reduce the load on the database and thus lower infrastructure costs?
- How are we currently managing storage costs, and are there opportunities to reduce them by archiving old data, compressing logs, or using tiered storage solutions?
- How will the upgrade to Jira 9.x affect our licensing costs, and are there any opportunities for savings through consolidation or changes in usage patterns?

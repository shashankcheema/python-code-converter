# Jira Upgrade and PostgreSQL Migration Plan

## Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning

### Initial Assessment and Documentation
- **Current State Analysis**: Document the current Jira setup, including the version, plugins, customizations, database configurations, and integrations. Identify any dependencies or interconnections with other systems, such as CI/CD pipelines, reporting tools, or data warehouses.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Review specific vulnerabilities identified by the security team, particularly those related to the current Jira version (8.x) and PostgreSQL database. Cross-reference these vulnerabilities with known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to understand their impact and severity.

### Engage Key Stakeholders
- **Security Team**: Collaborate with the security team to ensure all identified vulnerabilities are addressed in the upgrade plan. Discuss implementing additional security measures, such as IP whitelisting, enhanced logging, and audit trails post-upgrade.
- **Infrastructure Team**: Discuss the current infrastructure setup, including server specifications, resource utilization, and cost considerations. Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) or orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for better resource management and scalability.

### Upgrade Requirements Gathering
- **Compatibility Checks**: Identify all third-party plugins and custom integrations, ensuring their compatibility with Jira 9.12 or 9.17. Use Atlassian's compatibility matrix and reach out to vendors for any updates or patches required.
- **PostgreSQL Upgrade Path**: Determine the necessary steps to upgrade PostgreSQL to a secure and supported version. This might involve transitioning from PostgreSQL 9.x or 10.x to the latest stable release, which supports advanced features such as parallel query processing and enhanced JSON support.

### Develop a Detailed Migration Plan
- **Backup Strategy**: Plan a comprehensive backup strategy, including full backups of the Jira database, configurations, and application files. Ensure that backups are stored securely and are easily accessible in case a rollback is required.
- **Staging Environment Setup**: Create a staging environment that mirrors the production setup for testing. This environment should replicate the same hardware configurations, network settings, and data volume to identify potential performance issues.
- **Test Plan**:
  - **Functional Testing**: Ensure all Jira functionalities, especially those related to model metadata tracking, work as expected. This includes testing Jira's REST API endpoints to verify that data retrieval and updates are functioning correctly.
  - **Integration Testing**: Test all integrations with external systems, including any webhook-based integrations or data exports to other systems (e.g., BI tools or ETL processes).
  - **Security Testing**: Perform vulnerability scans in the staging environment post-upgrade using tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or custom scripts. Conduct penetration testing to ensure there are no exploitable vulnerabilities.
  - **Reindexing Test**: Given the requirement for a full reindex during the upgrade, simulate this process in the staging environment to estimate the time required and identify any performance bottlenecks.

## Major Changes and Technical Issues in Upgrading Jira from 8.20.x to 9.12/17

### Major Changes
- **End of Support for Server Licenses**: Jira 9.12 is the last version that supports server licenses, with support ending on February 15, 2024. Future updates will only be available for Data Center versions, which may require organizations to consider migrating to Atlassian Cloud or Data Center.
- **Reindexing Requirement**: Upgrading from Jira 8.x to 9.x triggers a full reindex, which can cause significant downtime. It's crucial to plan this upgrade during a low-activity period to minimize disruptions.
- **Database Structure Changes**: The upgrade introduces new database structures, such as new `_version` tables (e.g., `worklog_version`, `issue_version`, `comment_version`). Missing records in these tables need to be inserted manually during the upgrade process.
- **Updated Apache Tomcat**: The Apache Tomcat version is upgraded in Jira 9.10 to 9.0.75, which is not compatible with older New Relic agents (versions prior to 8.2.0). This update might necessitate an upgrade to your monitoring tools.
- **Automation Enhancements**: Jira 9.11 introduced significant enhancements to automation, including the "Look up issues" and "Create variable" actions, masking secret keys in automation rules, and enabling an allowlist for outbound HTTP requests by default.

### Potential Technical Issues
- **Plugin and Customization Compatibility**: Many third-party plugins and customizations may not be immediately compatible with Jira 9.x. Testing in a staging environment before upgrading is essential to identify and mitigate these issues.
- **Security Configuration Adjustments**: Post-upgrade, there may be a need to adjust security settings, such as reconfiguring SSL/TLS, updating authentication methods, or enabling new security features that weren't available in earlier versions.
- **Performance Impact During Reindexing**: The reindexing process can be resource-intensive, potentially affecting performance or causing system instability during the upgrade.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Given the database changes, it's critical to perform thorough data integrity checks before and after the upgrade to ensure that all data has been migrated correctly and that no records have been lost or corrupted.
- **Increased Resource Requirements**: The new features and enhancements in Jira 9.x may require more system resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This might necessitate hardware upgrades or cloud resource scaling to maintain performance.

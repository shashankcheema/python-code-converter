  - Set up role-based access control (RBAC) within Kubernetes.
  - Configure compliance checks and audits.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All sensitive PCI data is encrypted and masked appropriately.
  - RBAC policies are enforced, and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
  - Compliance checks are automated and integrated with the system.

- **Timeline**: 3 weeks

=== Milestone 4: Monitoring and Alerts Setup

- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate Datadog with the system for monitoring.
  - Set up dashboards and custom alerts for critical events.
  - Configure automated compliance checks in Jenkins.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - Datadog is actively monitoring the system, and alerts are functioning correctly.
  - Dashboards provide clear visibility into system performance and health.
  - Compliance checks are running automatically, with results reviewed regularly.

- **Timeline**: 2 weeks

=== Milestone 5: Testing and Validation

- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct unit, integration, and performance testing.
  - Perform security testing, including vulnerability assessments.
  - Validate all configurations and settings before deployment.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All tests are passed, confirming the system’s readiness for deployment.
  - Security vulnerabilities are addressed, and the system is deemed secure.
  - Configuration review is completed, with no outstanding issues.

- **Timeline**: 4 weeks

=== Milestone 6: Deployment and Go-Live

- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy the system to the production environment.
  - Monitor the initial operation and address any issues promptly.
  - Conduct a post-deployment review.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - The system is successfully deployed and operational in production.
  - Post-deployment monitoring shows stable operation with no critical issues.
  - The project is formally closed, and documentation is completed.

- **Timeline**: 2 weeks

== Gathering Results

=== Evaluation Criteria

1. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Verify that all PCI data is handled securely, with encryption and masking applied as specified.
   - Review access logs to confirm that RBAC is functioning correctly and that there are no unauthorized access attempts.

2. **System Performance**:
   - Assess the performance of PCI/CSI calculations and data processing under typical and peak loads.
   - Evaluate the efficiency of data flows between EFS, Pods, and Snowflake.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Confirm that Datadog is effectively monitoring the system and that alerts are being triggered appropriately.
   - Review the frequency and nature of alerts to identify any potential areas for optimization.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Test the system’s ability to scale in response to increased data volumes or processing demands.
   - Ensure that the architecture supports horizontal scaling without degradation in performance.

=== Post-Implementation Review

1. **Stakeholder Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders, including system users, administrators, and security officers, to ensure the solution meets their needs and expectations.

2. **Compliance Audit**:
   - Conduct a formal compliance audit to confirm adherence to PCI standards and identify any areas for improvement.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure that all system documentation, including configurations, processes, and user guides, is complete and accurate.

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Identify lessons learned during the implementation and post-deployment phases.
   - Develop a plan for ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and enhancement of the system to ensure it continues to meet evolving needs.
